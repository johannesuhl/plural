# PLURAL: Place-level rural-urban indices
PLURAL is a framework to create continuous classifications of "rurality" or "urbanness" based on the spatial configuration of populated places.
PLURAL makes use of the concept of "remoteness" to characterize the level of spatial isolation of a populated place with respect to its neighbors.
There are two implementations of PLURAL, including (a) PLURAL-1, based on distances to the nearest places of user-specified population classes, and (b) PLURAL-2, based on neighborhood characterization derived from spatial networks.
PLURAL requires simplistic input data, i.e., the coordinates (x,y) and population p of populated places (villages, towns, cities) in a given point in time. Due to its simplistic input, the PLURAL rural-urban classification scheme can be applied to historical data, as well as to data from data-scarce settings.

Using the PLURAL framework, we created place-level rural-urban indices for the conterminous United States from 1930 to 2018. These data are publicly available and con be downloaded at URL.
